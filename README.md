# Neural-Network-From-Scratch

I write these toy models for understanding details of neural nets when learning Professor Andrew Ng's Deep Learning in Coursera. 

1. Multilayer perceptron 

2. Recurrent neural net

3. Long short term memory(LSTM) ( debugging back propagation  Orz)

4. (Future) Convolutional neural net
